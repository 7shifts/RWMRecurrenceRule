# RWMRecurenceRule

Provides support for iCalendar RRULE expressions including an extension to [EventKit][] allowing you to create an [EKRecurrenceRule][] from an RRULE expression and to enumerate the dates of an [EKEvent][].

For complete details about iCalendar RRULE expressions, see the [Format Definition][] and [examples][] at [iCalendar.org][].

Note that you do not need to make any use of RRULE expressions to use this framework. If you just want to enumerate
the dates of an EKEvent, you can this framework to do so without any use or knowledge of RRULE syntax.

RWMRecurrenceRule can be used with iOS 9.0 and later, macOS 10.12 and later, and watchOS 2.0 and later.
